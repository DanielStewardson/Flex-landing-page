# Flex-landing-page

Codecademy task:
- Create a new landing page for a fictional company, using flex boxes

Went with a company that supplies spaces for work team meets, gaming or a beer:
 - Attempted a drop down nav menu with reactive elements(Not great on phone. But learned why, so still a win :D .)
 - Product cards in reactive flexbox layout
 - Added side widget with links to social media. Moves to act as bottom nav bar on smaller screens
 - links all dead
